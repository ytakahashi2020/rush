# What is Rush Quickstart?

> [!WARNING]
> ðŸš§ Rush is under heavy development. Expect **bugs**, **crashes**, **breaking changes**, and **partial experiences** so we can ship fast, break things, and iterate to bring you the best onchain game development experience.

**Rush Quickstart** is a simple Bevy game repository demonstrating how a Bevy game can be converted into an onchain game by using SonicSVM's Rush ECS framework.
